# Windows Apps Auto-Installer Script

No more boring "next, next, install" installation process for your applications. This script automatically installs the apps I use for web development and content creation.

### Feel free to edit the script to include your suggested apps. Here you will find more applications to include: https://winget.run/


## How to use
Run as administrator your Windows Terminal or Powershell Console and run the script from there. You will have to give permission at startup, then Windows will be able to install all the applications by itself.
