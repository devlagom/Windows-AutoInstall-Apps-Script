# Windows dev/creator setup
This repository contains a winget auto-installer script of a list of tools that I use on my computer for both development environment and content creation/editing. 

Feel free to add/modify the list of tools included. To automatically install the applications forgetting the boring "next, next, install" just run the .ps1 file from the PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
